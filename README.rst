This project has recently been updated to include experimental support for the **OpenAI API**. The primary motivation behind this integration is to explore and test the capabilities of **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting techniques within the context of [**briefly mention your project's main purpose here, e.g., "this honeypot," "this security tool," etc.**].

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice:**
* The initial code for this OpenAI integration was partially generated with the assistance of **Cursor AI**.
* This feature is currently **under active testing and development**. Expect potential bugs or unexpected behavior. We appreciate your understanding and any feedback you can provide!

## ‚ú® Core Idea: Testing Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

The main goal of integrating the OpenAI API is to experiment with Chain-of-Thought prompting. We aim to see how CoT can [**explain what you hope CoT will achieve in your project, e.g., "improve the realism of interactive sessions," "generate more insightful alerts," "automate complex analysis tasks"**].

## üöÄ Getting Started: Configuration

To enable the OpenAI API functionality, you'll need to configure your OpenAI API key.

### Prerequisites:
* An active OpenAI API key. You can obtain one from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

### Configuration Steps:

1.  **Locate the Configuration File:**
    The configuration for this project, including the OpenAI API key, is managed in `cowrie.cfg.dist`. You will typically find this file at:
    ```
    /etc/cowrie.cfg.dist
    ```
    *(This path suggests a system-wide installation, often associated with tools like Cowrie honeypot. If your project structure is different, please adjust this path accordingly.)*

2.  **Create Your Local Configuration:**
    It's standard practice **not** to edit `.dist` files directly. Instead, you should copy it to create your local configuration file:
    ```bash
    sudo cp /etc/cowrie.cfg.dist /etc/cowrie.cfg
    ```
    *(You might need `sudo` if modifying files in `/etc/`)*.
    **All your custom configurations should be made in `cowrie.cfg`.**

3.  **Add Your OpenAI API Key:**
    Open `/etc/cowrie.cfg` (or your local copy) with a text editor. You'll need to find or add the section for OpenAI API configuration and input your key. The exact parameter name might vary based on the implementation, but it would look something like this:

    ```ini
    [openai]
    api_key = YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
    # You might also have other related settings here, e.g.:
    # model = text-davinci-003
    # cot_prompt_template = "Think step by step to achieve X..."
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual OpenAI API key.

    **üîí Security Best Practice:**
    * **NEVER commit your `cowrie.cfg` file (or any file containing your actual API key) to a public Git repository.**
    * Ensure that `cowrie.cfg` (or the specific name of your local configuration file) is listed in your project's `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental uploads.

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Status & Known Limitations

* **Experimental Feature:** This integration is new and should be considered alpha or beta quality.
* **AI-Assisted Code:** While helpful, code generated by tools like Cursor may require further review and refinement for robustness and security.
* **Testing Underway:** We are actively testing this feature. Performance, reliability, and output quality may vary.
* [**Optional: Add any other specific known issues or limitations here.**]

## üí° How It Works (High-Level)

[**Optional: Briefly explain how the OpenAI API is triggered or used within your project. For example:**]
* "When a specific command pattern is detected..."
* "User inputs are sent to the OpenAI API with a CoT prompt to generate a more human-like or analytical response..."
* "The system periodically uses the API to analyze collected logs for anomalies..."

## üîÆ Future Plans (Optional)

* Refine CoT prompts for better accuracy and relevance.
* Implement more robust error handling for API calls.
* Gather performance metrics.
* [**Add other future ideas here.**]

## ü§ù Contributing (Optional)

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to help improve this feature or the project in general, please feel free to:
* Test the OpenAI integration and report any bugs or issues.
* Suggest improvements to the CoT prompts.
* Submit Pull Requests with code enhancements.
* Share your ideas and feedback.
